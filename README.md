# Karamoja_Project

#Business Problem
Karamoja region in Uganda comprises of eight districts (Kotido District, Kaabong District, Karenga District, Nabilatuk District, Abim District, Moroto District, Napak District, Amudat District and Nakapiripirit District) in the North Eastern part of Uganda.Unfortunately, it's one of the most food insecure regions.

The districts of Karamoja have the highest Human Poverty Indices (HPI).Poverty is increasing and one of the main factors responsible for poverty is persistent poor harvest.

Several NGO's provide technical support to farmers experiencing low yields. However, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often rely on some very local sources of information to conduct their work.

Dalberg Data Insights needs to develop a strategy to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the Karamoja

#Business Understanding
We need to find out:

-What is the total maize and sorghum production in the region?

-Can other crops be grown on the crop area?

-Which staple food does better?

-How much of the crop area bears yields?

#The Data
Before doing any analysis, we need to be able to access and manipulate the data. The data being used has been uploaded in this repository(DATA.zip). Since it's a zipped file, we first start by extracting the file then is when we can explore the data.

#Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Now we have access to the data, we can explore it and make necessary amends. In this project, the google colab IDE has been used. The data is first loaded to the notebook. The necessary libraries are then imported. The data can then be previewed to see it's size, number of columns and rows, perform statistical calculations and get a glimpse of what we're working with.

Once that is done, we can now clean the data. This includes checking for missing values, duplicate values, dropping irrelevant columns, adding columns, changing the title case for the columns and so much more.

All this procedures have been clearly explained and demonstrated in the notebook and the table of contents will guide through the notebook.

#Data Visualization
Once the data is cleaned, it can now be visualized. For this project, the visualizations have been done on Tableau Public. Regional maps, heatmaps and bar charts have been used to visualize the data to answer our objectives. Two dashboards have then been created to summarise the visuals that have been made. The regional maps provide the NGO's with the overall state of the Karamoja region. The visuals can all be seen in the Tableau workbook and the Tableau story will guide you through it.

#Presentation
After every research, we must present our ideas. The slides give a snippet of what the research entails and the findings. Among the recommendations that can be given after doing the vast analysis is, increasing productivity of sorghum in Amudat District, increasing productivity of maize in Moroto District and planting other crops that can do well in the 84,512 hectares of land.
